Mainly refer to https://github.com/auroua/tf_rfcn and https://github.com/endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn

Thanks for auroua and endernewton's help.

This code is for primary students to use.

Very easy to use.

You only need to type few words in the console to operate it.

The shell script will help you to do everything: train,test, val,demo ,auto-image-loading and csv-txt result-saving.
