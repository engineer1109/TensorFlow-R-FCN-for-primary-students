# TensorFlow-R-FCN-for-primary-students
## 1.Introduction
R-FCN Tensorflow version for primary students

Mainly refer to https://github.com/auroua/tf_rfcn and https://github.com/endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn

Thanks for auroua and endernewton's help.

This code is for primary students to use.

What is different from theirs?

1. Support Python3 Train and Test

2. Support Chinese Language of detecting result

3. More easy to use and small changes
